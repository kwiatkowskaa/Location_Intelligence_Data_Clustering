# Location_Intelligence_Data_Clustering
**Clustering with Location Intelligence Data - README**

**Project Overview:**

Welcome to our clustering project utilizing Location Intelligence Data sourced from Google Maps. This project is part of a Machine Learning course at University of Technology in Warsaw. This dataset provides a comprehensive view of businesses across various countries, offering insights into business operations, location specifics, and customer interactions. As we embark on this project, our aim is to explore the spatial distribution of businesses, identify geographic patterns, and cluster locations based on their features and characteristics.

**Project Stages:**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyze location-based data such as points of interest and their attributes.
   - Understand the distribution and characteristics of businesses across different regions.
   - Identify any trends or patterns present in the data.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Develop geographic and statistical features to aid in identifying patterns of land use.
   - Create new features or transform existing ones to enhance clustering effectiveness.
   - Utilize domain knowledge to engineer relevant features that capture spatial relationships.

3. **Modeling and Validation:**
   - Apply spatial clustering algorithms to group locations based on their features and attributes.
   - Assess the effectiveness of clustering using spatial metrics.
   - Validate the clusters generated and interpret the results to gain insights into spatial patterns and relationships.
